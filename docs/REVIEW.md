# Security and public-source review

Reviewed the provider declaration, host entry, tests, smoke script, manifest, lockfile, documentation, and generated package inventory.

- Plugin-owned runtime code contains no shell execution, HTTP route, credential handling, telemetry collector, credential persistence, or install hook. The shared SDK handles subprocesses and ACP transport.
- Fixed launch arguments preserve vendor approval checks in Accept edits mode and disable CLI telemetry. No permission bypass flags or arbitrary endpoint overrides are added. Explicitly selecting Full access makes the shared bridge approve permission requests.
- No account identifiers, personal email addresses, home-directory paths, tokens, CLI state, or session recordings are intentionally shipped. Package contents use an allowlist; dependencies, scratch scaffold, environment files, logs, and local Git metadata are excluded. Published package contents exclude source maps, which can contain local build paths.
- npm audit reported zero known vulnerabilities at verification time. This is not a guarantee against unknown vulnerabilities or an independent audit of upstream code.
- MIT applies to this project's original source. The dependency SDK declares MIT; other dependencies and Google's service retain their own terms.

Verified on Windows: TypeScript check, launch-policy regression test, BB build and plugin reload, live model/mode discovery, and native ACP initialize/session/new/prompt against the installed signed-in CLI. The prompt returned the requested marker without tool access.

Remaining before public release: public owner/source metadata, clean Git-source installation, BB conversation UI exercise including approvals/cancellation/resume, marketplace validation and screenshots, and platform checks outside Windows. These are release gates rather than claims of completed validation.
